HTML & CSS Notes


Basic html page template:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
  <head>
    <meta charset='UTF-8' />
    <title>Title</title>
    <link rel='stylesheet' href='styles.css'/>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class='page'>
      <div class='menu'>Menu</div>
      <div class='sidebar'>Sidebar</div>
      <div class='content'>Content</div>
      <div class='footer'>Footer</div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>



Some CSS sizing rules from the internet:

----
px: Setting base size for your project (define on body). Typically used minimally, with em doing the brunt of hte work

rem: Setting relative size (headings, body text, etc). Used liberally for 'generic ui elements' and often avoided for specifics.

em: Setting styles inline with your content (subscript, superscript, 'effects' on your items that are dependent on the item's size, etc). Used liberally for 'custom ui elements' and often avoided for generics. iirc it represents uppercase letter scale of the font.

vw/vh: Filling viewports, often used alongside media queries. Typically used for wrappers around your content.

vmin/vmax: Filling viewports based on the smallest/largest available size, often used alongside media queries. Typically used for wrappers around your content.

%: use when parent is a fixed size, or to 100% fill a container, often used alongside media queries. Typically used in subwrappers to scale content.

ch: explicitly defining width of a section of text, typically used for paragraphs and inputs

lh: vertically aligning block elements with text, typically used with inline block elements that need to be aligned along a center horizontal axis

ex: rarely used over em, but typically for vertical measurements of text. iirc represents lowercase letter scale of the font.

----
Rem for general sizing ( texts, margin, paddings, etc) bonus points if you enforce a scale ( for example always use multiples of 4 ) -em for text size relative to parent

Vw/vh when you need to do something relative to screen size ( "I want this element to be exactly half the screen height" )

% is usually used along with transforms or sizing of elements relative to parent.

HTML:

<em> and <strong> can be used in-line to make a text italic or bold respectively.

<div> and <span> are similar, one is block-type, other is inline.

We can link to certain parts of a page by providing an id to the element we want to focus on and adding it at the end of the href of an a link:
<p id="focus-target"></p>
...
<a href="index.html#focus-target"></a> (index.html being the page the p is part of)
If we link to an element on the same page, we can ommit the URL entirely and only point to #focus-target



CSS:

display defines type of box: none (hidden), block, inline, inline-box, flex, flexbox, etc. Difference between inline and inline-box is that inline-box allows to set a width and height and also it doesn not ignore top and bottom margins/paddings. Difference between block and inline-block is that inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.

padding/margin template: top right bottom left OR verticla horizontal. ex: padding: 20px 10px 20px 10px is same as 20px 10px

border template: size style color. ex: border: 1px solid red;

Bullet icons for <li> can be altered using list-style-type (circle, lower-roman, etc), or even using list-style-image for a custom bullet. None removes any bullets, being useful for things like navigation menus.

text-decoration can be used to underline or dash through a text.

font-weight can be used to make text bold/normal, while font-style can make it italic/normal.

Inline boxes ignore margin top/bottom, but take into consideration padding top/bottom. Left/right are unaffected on both.

Margin collapse: having two boxes on top of each other, each with their own margin, makes the margin collapse (on top of each other), meaning if one has a margin of 50px and the other 25px, the total margin will be 50px (the bigger of the two). This can be avoided through a number of methods: only set margin-top or margin-bottom on all elements or add an invisible div with a styling of padding:1px between the two elements, which will act as a border. If using flexbox, margins don't collapse and this problem does not apply.

box-sizing: content-box vs border-box -> setting width/height, context-box doesn't take into account padding and border (meaning total width is our width + border + padding). For border-box, the total width includes padding and border (so basically it will be our width - padding - borders)

For text-alignment, we have text-align (right, left, center, etc). For content alignemnt, we have auto margins, floats or flexbox. Floats and flexbox will be covered later. For auto margins, we need to set the width/height for each margin set (if we want to only set margin auto horizontally, we only need width, if we only want it vertically, we need height, for both, you get the idea). It is set to auto by replacing the size with auto: 
margin: 20px auto (top/bottom margin of 20px and centered on right/left)

To override default styles, we can use the universal CSS selector, "*":
* {
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
	box-sizing: border-box;
}
This would eliminate the default margins and paddings set by the browser by default.

Classes precedence: if we have two classes that modify the same property and both of them ge applied to the same element, the class lower down in the css file takes precedence (if multiple css files are loaded, the class in the latest loaded css file applies)
ex: 
<p class="first-class second-class"></p>
.first-class {
	width: 300;
	height: 200;
}
.second-class {
	height: 100;
}
p will have a width and height of 300/100.
class="first-class second-class" and class="second-class first-class" are the same, order here does not affect precedence.


Child combinator: we can style direct children of elements by using the ">" sign. ex: div > .testClass will reffer to children of divs that have the class of testClass.

Main pseudo-classes for links: a:link, a:visited, a:hover, a:active . Can be combined, such as a:visited:hover (hover over visited link) or a:visited:active (clicking on visited link)

Precedence is overriden by specificity. Order is as follows (from greatest to least):
- id selectors: #button-2
- class + pseudo-class: .button:link
- element type + pseudot-class AND class + children: a:link AND .some-class p
- class selectors: .button
- element type selectors: div


Floats:
float right/left to align block elements to right or left (margin auto still for center). 
clear: right/left/both to make an element ignore float right/left or both.

By adding an "overflow: hidden" declaration to a container div, weâ€™re telling it to recognize the height of any floated elements it contains.

To summarize, when you have an extra unfloated HTML element at the bottom of a container div, use the clear solution. Otherwise, add an overflow: hidden declaration to the container element. The underlying idea for both options is that you need a way to tell the browser to incorporate floats into the height of their container element in order for their backgrounds to show up.


FLEXBOX:

We define an element as a flex container by adding "display: flex;" to its CSS. 

We align items horizontally within the flex container with the property justify-content and values: flex-start / center / flex-end / space-around / space-between. These are applied to the container, not the child elements.

We align items vertically within the flex container with the property align-center and values: center, flex-start (top), flex-end (bottom), stretch, baseline. Stretch stretches the element on the full height of the parent. For baseline, check https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34606879/whats-the-difference-between-flex-start-and-baseline. For short, flex-start aligns the top of the child items, baseline aligns the bottoms of the content of the child items.

space-around and space-between automatically distributes space to either side of each item of the container. The difference between the two is that space-around also allocates space before the first item and after the last, while the space-between one only allocates space between elements.

We can modify the orientation of our flex items by using flex-direction. For example, default is row (horizontal), but we can opt for column for vertical alignment. If we switch to vertical alignment, horizontal and vertical alignment properties switch, justify-content being for verticality and vice-versa. We can also use row-reverse or column-reverse to display items in reverse order.

We can align the items within a container (children) with align-items.

FLEX ITEM ORDER:

We can add an order property to flex items (default is 0) so that we can move it right or left (can take negative numbers).

We can use align-self on item classes in order to override the align-items of the parent container.

Using the flex property, we can set the ratio of space that a particular element should ocupy of the parent. For example, if we add 3 elements to a parent and set flex: 0.3; each element will take 30% of the parent and leave 10% free space. Setting it to 1 will mean all elements will take equal parts of the whole space. Setting two of them to 1 and the last to 2 will mean the last one will take twice as much space as each of the other two. This can help us with scaling individual containers within their parents.

We can use flex: initial; on individual items and set static sizes. 
Ex: we can set a general flex: 1 to 3 items, then on two individual items set a flex: initial; with width of 300px; On resizing the page, the one item that has a flex of 1 will be resized, while the ones that have a width of 300px will stay the same.

An alternative to using extra divs in order to align a group of items to the left or right, we can use margin-left/margin-right: auto, which uses up all the space left to the side of the element (margin-left: auto "glues" the element to the right of the container, opposite for margin-right). So we can use, for example, justify-content: space-between for 3 elements, but we want the last two to be next to each other. We can put the last two in a separate container, but to avoid this, we can se the middle one to margin-left: auto, which would yield the same result.
